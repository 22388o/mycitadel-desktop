Description: Bitcoin, RGB and Lightning wallet
  MyCitadel is a wallet for bitcoin, digital assets and bitcoin finance (#BiFi)
  smart contracts. It is blazingly fast, secure, cross-platform and technically
  most advanced wallet on the market, being the first wallet allowing taproot
  multi-sig and timelock-based spending conditions.
  .
  Do a reliable hodling (with inheritance options), corporate/organization &
  current accounts - or instant Lightning payments. Work with single- and
  multi-sig setups, based on hardware, air-gaped, cold and server-side hot key
  storage, involving arbitrary complex time-lock scripts (with miniscript) and
  wide interoperability (because of use of wallet descriptors).
