Wallet for bitcoin, digital assets and bitcoin finance (#BiFi) smart contracts.

Tool for reliable hodling (with inheritance options), corporate & organization 
use, current accounts with instant Lightning payments. Works with single- and 
multisig setups, based on hardware, air-gaped, cold and server-side hot key 
storage, involving arbitrary complex time-lock scripts (with miniscript) and 
wide interoperability (because of use of wallet descriptors). Taproot-enabled 
from day one, including multisig- and script-based taproot.
